Description:
Everybody knows it!
You are not a real coder if you ainâ€™t never done an Intro with a good old toroid in the middle! :D
Thanks and Greetings go to Fabrice Neyret for inspiring me, Superogue, Gigabates, Pestis and Phaze101's people.
The realization of this Intro was possible thanks to the support and approval of my beloved Vix
...as well as the patience of my daughters :D

(run it on TIC80 with CRT Monitor option ON)
